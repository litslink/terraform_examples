# Terraform ECS with EC2
A set of **Terraform** templates used as an example of deployment ***AWS*** infrastructure with ***ECS EC2***.

## About this project
This repository contains Terraform configuration for **ECS** with **EC2** (`EC2` directory).

Templates deploy via Terraform a default nginx docker image and set up required AWS services. For example: IAM, Load Balancer, S3, VPC, CloudWatch (including Auto Scaling and Logs) and Route53 with ACM (add DNS records, create and validate certificate). 

## Prerequisites

- Install `terraform`, to get started, visit [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html).
- (Optional) Install `aws-cli`, to get started, visit [docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).
## Getting started

- Create an AWS IAM user with administrative access to: `ECS`, `ECR`, `RDS`, `EC2`, `ACM`, `Route53` and `S3`.
- Download directory with template file.
- Edit the template "sample_variables.template" files and fill it with variables relevant to the environment you're preparing:


```bash
    # for the Fargate:
    cp EC2/sample_variables.template EC2/variables.tf
```

- Edit `variables.tf` file.

## Usage
Typically, the base Terraform will only need to be run once, and then should only need changes but hardly ever.

Change the directory to the relevant environment you want to initialize ( `cd EC2` ).

### Environment initialization
Run the *init* command.
```bash
    # The first command only for initializing (only if didn't start before)
    terraform init

```
### Start/change an environment
Run the *plan* or *apply* command.
```bash
    # to show changes list
    terraform plan

    # to apply the changes
    terraform apply
```

### Stopping(destroying) an environment
Run the *destroy* command.

**Warning!!!** the command will not just stop but completely remove the infrastructure used for this environment :

```bash
    # Run the destroy command
    terraform destroy
```

## Components

These components are for a specific environment. There should be a corresponding directory for each environment that is needed.
